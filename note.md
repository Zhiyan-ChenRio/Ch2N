#Chapter 2 Notes
##2.1: 
      The concept of computing in a "cloud" has its origins in utility computing, proposed by computer scientistJohn McCarthy in 1961
      Back in 1990s, the idea of compyter utilities began to take shape with the emergence of internet-based services like search engines, email, and socail media platform. 
      As described, cloud computing is ideal as a model that enabled ubiquious, on demand access to configurable computing resources, with five essential characteristic, three service models, and four deployment models. 
##2.2:
      Business drivers: it has shaped the development of modern cloud technolog, motivating organizations to adopt it and provides others cloud services. 
      Capacity Planning: the process of determining and fullfilling future demands of an organization'sIT resources, products, and services; Capcity planning are: LeadStrategy, Lag Stratey and Match Strategy
      Cost Reduction: A direct alignment between IT costs and business performance can be difficult to maintain. 
      Organizational Agility: Given the restrictions posed by IT equipment and infrastructure, budgetary limitations, and the inability to meet continually changing market demands, adaptability becomes essential for a company's growth and effective data management
##2.3: Concepts and Terminology:
      Cloud: a non-physical IT enciroment that is designed for the purpose of remotely provisioning scalable and measured IT resources. 
      IT resources: Both address to the physical or virtual IT artifact that can be either software based or hardware-based. 
      On-Premise: As a distinct and remotely accessible environment, a cloud represents an option for the deployment of IT resources
      Scaling: the ability of the IT resource to handle increased or decreased usage demands. 
      Horizontal Scaling: The horizontal allocation of resources is referred to as scaling out and the horizontal releasing of resources is referred to as scaling in.
      Vertical Scaling: IT resources is replaced by another with higher or lower capacity
      Cloud Service: NOT all IT resources residing within a cloud can be made avaiable for remote access. 
      Cloud Service Consumer: Temporary runtime role
##2.4: Goals and Benefits:
      Reduced Investments and Proportional Costs: scalibilty!!
##2.5: Risks and Challenges:
      Increased Security Vulnerabilities: cybersercurity
##2.6:From Google's Perspective: 
      1.Cloud computing is user-centric: Data/files you stores on cloud is yours
      2.Cloud computing is task-centric: software functionality become more important.
      3.Cloud Computing is accessible: everthing stores online
      4.Cloud computing is powerful: it creates a wealth of computing power impossible with a single desktop PC
      5.Cloud computing is intellignt: with all the data stored on the compiter in the cloud, data mining and analysis are necessary to access this information in an interlligent manner.
      6. Cloud computing is programmable: automated
##2.7 From Amazon's Perspective:
      1. Trade capital expense for variable expense: scaliability; pay only what you're using
      2. Benefit from massive economies of scale: achieve a lower variable cost 
      3. Stop guessing capacity: you get to make decision of the capcity 
      4. Increase speed and agility: reduce time and make resources avaiable
      5. Stop spending money on running and maintaining data centers: save money
      6. Go global in minutes: you can access data anywhere in the world
#2.8 & 2.9: Cloud computoing services: 
      1. SAAS: Software as a service
      2. PAAS: Platform as a service
      3. IAAS: Infrastructure as a service
